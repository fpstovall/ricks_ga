		 ** 
		 ** Configuration files are defined as follows.
		 ** 
		 ** 1. Files are read line by line. No value can cross a newline
		 **    (and at least in this version) or include one. The good
		 **    news is that you are allowed up to 16k for each line.
		 **    
		 ** 2. values are specifed in name/value pairs, one per line, with
		 ** 	 the name first, followed by whitespace, followed by the 
		 ** 	 value. Values may include whitespace. All leading and trailing
		 ** 	 whitespace is removed from both the name and the value.
		 ** 	 
		 ** 3. Comments start with a \# symbol; all text following a \# is
		 **    ignored. If you need to use \# in a name or value, escape
		 **    it with a backslash instead.
		 **    
		 ** 4. Duplicate names are allowed.
		 ** 
		 ** 5. Names without values will be stored with "" as the value.
		 ** 
		 ** 6. A configuration file may include another configuration file
		 **    automatically by the use of the "*INCLUDE" reserved name.
		 **    When this name is found, it's value is used as the name of
		 **    the new file to be read.
		 **/

		/** Reads and parses the command line and the provided file.
		 ** 
		 ** Returns the number of values stored. argc and argv are, of 
		 ** course the same names you used as arguments to main(). Therefore
		 ** you can easily read all command line and configuration file 
		 ** values like this:
		 ** 
		 ** int main(int argc, char* argv[])
		 **
		 ** {
		 **
		 ** 	conf_reader config;
		 **
		 ** 	config.read(argc,argv,"my_conf_file");

		 ** 	...
		 **
		 ** }
		 ** 
		 ** See read(filename,_clear) for a discription of how configuration
		 ** files are structured and parsed. This method unconditionally
		 ** clears the existing value list before starting. For command line
		 ** arguments the following rules are true.
		 ** 
		 ** 1. The executable name (argv[0]) is stored as a value with the 
		 **    name "__exec_name".
		 **   
		 ** 2. Command line arguments of the form "name=value" are parsed
		 **    stored as named values.
		 ** 
		 ** 3. All other command line arguments are stored as names with 
		 **    value = "".
		 **    
		 ** 4. A command line argument of form "configfile=filename" will
		 **    override the filename supplied as an argument to this method.
		 **    
		 ** 5. In the case of duplicate command line arguments, the last one 
		 **    specified wins.
		 **    
		 ** 6. In the case of names in the configuration file duplicating 
		 **    names from the command line, the values from the command line
		 **    dominate. If there were multiple values for a given name 
		 **    specified in the file, only the first one (the one returned by
		 **    the "[]" operator or get<>() method) is overridden.
